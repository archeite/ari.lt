                <h1>dear casey,</h1>

                <p>
                    i hope this open letter brings a smile to your face, as i
                    sit here, i am overwhelmed with the gratitude i feel towards
                    our friendship with have created over the past 5 years, you
                    have been there for me always, as if you were onlinne mother
                    and providing support for me that i cherish so deeply and am
                    very thankful for
                </p>

                <p>
                    our inside jokes and shared moments, experiences, etc have
                    truly been the highlight of my life, they are reminders of
                    the bond that we've created over the time we've been friends
                    for, they remind me of the tears and laughs we've had
                    together and reminds me of how much time we've spent
                    together,, i still remember the time we connected, purely by
                    chance seemingly xD, when i still used to use facebook and
                    my fb acc got hacked, at the time i was in some lgbt support
                    group and i wanted to add one person from that group, i
                    guess i must've mixed you up with someone from that group
                    and added you instead xDDD, well, little did i know that
                    this would blossom into a such a beautiful and meaningful
                    relationship xD
                </p>

                <p>
                    i remember one other thing related to facebook, when u
                    helped me to create a fake straight-looking facebook account
                    xD, because my mother kept on incisting on getting my social
                    media and stuff, i remember u helping me set up a password
                    on every app so if she tries to take my phone again and look
                    through it she couldn't do shit xD, you helped me to express
                    myself authentically without any fear of repercussions, you
                    have such an incredible character and a generous heart and i
                    dont think i will ever be able to repay for you for such
                    noble acts
                </p>

                <p>
                    as time passes, i realize how much you have impacted my life
                    and,, not only have you been an emotional pillar, but you've
                    also helped me understand and see the world of adulthood,
                    for example i remember the time when i was confused about
                    taxes and u explained it to me xDD, never have i thought i'd
                    be sitting and asking people about 'what are taxes like
                    actually xD', your wisdom has become invaluable to me, its
                    kinda sweet but bitter, bittersweet i think would b the best
                    word to describe it abt how i feel abt u getting older, its
                    nice that you're growing and developing an independent life
                    and going off studying in another country, but the thought
                    of never being able to meet you fills me with regret and
                    sadness, i hope i get to meet you before you move, i
                    remember the time when i felt bad abt meeting u on easter,
                    that honestly is one of my top regrets because
                    hjfewhewfihwiuehf xD, but i very much do cherish moments
                    we've spent together no matter the distance
                </p>

                <p>
                    ive recently noticed that i havent expressed my love for you
                    as i should have, recalling our conversations,, while i
                    think you understand how much i appriciate you and how much
                    i cherish you and all that, i think i should be more
                    explicit with my platonic towards you, this is why i begun
                    saying words 'i love you' more, as i can't show it much by
                    actions, i wish we lived closer to one another to see one
                    another more frequently, so i could express my love in other
                    ways, but for now i'm basically left with words, and that's
                    what i'm trying to do, your presence in my life is a gift
                    and i am eternally grateful to be a part of yours <3
                </p>

                <p>
                    thank you for being an amazing friend that you are, your
                    support, understanding and guidance have made a profound
                    impact on me,, whether we're laughing or having
                    heart-to-heart conversations, every moment with you is a
                    treasure, i am honored to call you my best friend
                </p>

                <p>with all my love and gratitude and everything there is,</p>
